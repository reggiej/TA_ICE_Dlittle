 * <p>
 * <b>Description</b>: OrderedCollections, used in TopLink SDK, must be tracked differently from regulat Collections.
 * As the objects in the collection have a particular index which must be stored. This class stores the objects which must be written
 * into the collection and the indexes they must be written in at.  Inserting a new element at the beginning of the list will result
 * in the intire list being stored in the change set as the index of all other objects has changed.  Everything after the remove index will
 * be remove.
